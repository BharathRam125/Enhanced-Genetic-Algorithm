# Hybrid Algorithm for Path Planning using APF and Genetic Algorithm #

## Requirements

To run the code, ensure you have the following Python modules installed:

1. `numpy`: For numerical computations.
2. `matplotlib`: For visualization of paths and results.
3. `networkx`: For graph-based operations.
4. `pyvis`: For interactive visualization of graphs (optional).


## To execute the code

Run the `APF.py` script.
